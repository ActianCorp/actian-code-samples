## Data Set

The data used in this demo was exported from the Ingres **airline** table and cleaned up slightly for simpler use by the demo code.

The target table is created and populated by running the script **initData.bat** which executes the code in **InitData.java**.

Schema for the demo **airline** table:

    al_id         INTEGER
    al_ccode      VARCHAR(255)
    al_iatacode   VARCHAR(255)
    al_icaocode   VARCHAR(255)
    al_name       VARCHAR(255)

The table contains an additional INTEGER column named `id` which is an identity column that is auto-generated by the annotations in file **Airline.java** and serves the requirement to uniquely identify each row (per section [3.7](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#identifiers) of the Hibernate ORM User Guide).
